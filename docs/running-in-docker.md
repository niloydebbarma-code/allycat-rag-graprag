# Running Allycat Using Docker

This is the quickest way to try out Allycat.  No setup needed.  Just need Docker runtime.

The docker container has:

- All code and python libraries installed
- Ollama installed for serving local models
- Python web UI installed

## Prerequisites:

[Docker](https://www.docker.com/) or compatible environment.

## Step-1: Download Allycat Docker

```bash
docker   pull    sujee/allycat
```

## Start the Allycat Docker

Let's start the docker in 'dev' mode

```bash
docker run -it --rm -p 8080:8080  -v allycat-vol1:/allycat/workspace  sujee/allycat
```

- `-p 8080:8080`: maps port 8080 to the web UI
- `-v allycat-vol1:/allycat/workspace` maps a volume into workspace directory.  This way all of our work (downloaded web content, models ..etc) would be saved.

After the successfull container start, you will be within the container in shell.

## Docker Container Layout

The working directory will be `/allycat`

All downloaded artifacts such as website content, models would be under `/allycat/workspace` directory.
